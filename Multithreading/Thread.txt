To achieve Multiprocessing and Multithreading both are used to get Multitasking.
Thread in a nut shell are:
Threads are used to store a memory area
Threads are faster in switching content
A thread is a light-weight whereas processes are heavyweight.

Flow of control in Java
Without threading
main -> Function 1 -> Function 2 -> End
With Thread

main 
Function 1 => End
Function 2

Thread can be accessed by using this keyword
1. Extends Thread Class
2. Implements Runnable Interface


Life cycle of a Thread (meaning: Thread States)
1) New
The thread is in new state if you create an instance of Thread class but before the invocation of 
start() method.

2) Runnable
The thread is in runnable state after invocation of start() method, but the thread scheduler has not 
selected it to be the running thread.

3) Running
The thread is in running state if the thread scheduler has selected it.

4) Non-Runnable (Blocked)
This is the state when the thread is still alive, but is currently not eligible to run.

5) Terminated
A thread is in terminated or dead state when its run() method exits
