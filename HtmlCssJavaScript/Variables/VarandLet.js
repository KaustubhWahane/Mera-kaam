//The main difference when it comes between var and let is the block which means the scope of the variable
var a = 69
{
var a = "Ohio oniichan"
console.log(a)
}
console.log(a)
// So as you can see i can change the data type at any respective area as possible

// In case of Let 
let b = 69
{
    let b = 'Ohio onichan'
    console.log(b)
}
console.log(b)
