Dom tree refers to the HTML page where all the
nodes are objects. These can be 3 main types of 
nodes in the DOM tree :
1. Text nodes
2. Element nodes
3. Comment nodes

Children of an Element
Direct as well as deeply nested elements of an element are called its Children
Child nodes - Elements that are direct Children 
For Eg- head and body tag are children of html tag
Descendant nodes - All nested elements , children , their children and so on..

FirstChild
element.FirstChild = FirstChild element
element.lastChild = LastChild element
element.Childnodes = All Child nodes 

Accessing Child from element
Childnodes looks like an array .But its not actually an array it's a collection we can use Array from (Collection) to convert
it into an array.(Array methods won't work)

Siblings in DOM
Consider the situation where body and head  tags after body tag comes head tag where body tag is represented by next or right
sibling of head where head is said to be the previous or left sibling of body
